"""Evidence supervisor for the tenkz release-test inventory.

`docs/tenkz/SOAK-1.0.md` §Release payload evidence is the authority for
everything here.  The supervisor reads the pinned policy block out of
`docs/tenkz/DESIGN.md`, checks the closed inventory against it, builds one
repository-shaped view per command, runs the command in that view, and emits a
payload receipt.  It is release-test code, so it imports nothing from
`scripts/` and nothing outside this tree.

Subcommands:

    check-inventory   grammar, path roles, and policy agreement, no execution
    run --test ID     observe-release-test: build the view and run one test
    run-all           every inventory test in inventory order
    pins              the three activation pins as the current tree computes them
    check-readiness   what the enforcement state permits at this tree

What the view is, and what it is not.  It is *declarative* isolation: it
contains exactly the pinned trees, the inventory, the command's declared
subjects, and — with a tag — the tag-derived manifest, so a command that reads
only what it declared cannot see anything else, and a receipt names everything
it could have seen.  It is not a sandbox.  Three limits follow and none is
closed by anything this file can do:

  * the command runs as the user that built the view and owns every path in
    it, so it can `chmod` a sealed file or directory back and then modify it;
  * nothing stops it reading an absolute path outside the view;
  * nothing stops it opening a socket.

The mode bits below therefore stop an accident, not an adversary.  Closing all
three needs a mount namespace and an identity that does not own the view, which
the ledger assigns to the enforcement workflow and not to the supervisor;
`RELEASE-POLICY.md` §2 records the boundary.  Read a payload receipt as
evidence about a cooperating command, which is what a release test is.
