"""The supervisor self-test.

`docs/tenkz/SOAK-1.0.md` §Release payload evidence requires a closed self-test
suite from the pinned support tree, run against pinned synthetic fixtures,
before the campaign may be armed. Its receipt binds the code and support trees,
the output mount, the environment, the access denials, the tool fingerprints,
and the completion of every isolation probe.

The suite has two halves. The *probes* drive `selftest_probe.py` through the
real supervisor and check what a command sees from inside the view. The
*guards* call the supervisor's own entry points against synthetic filesystem
fixtures the suite builds and destroys, because the escapes they cover —
symlinks, special file modes, an incomplete receipt — cannot be staged from
inside a view that is supposed to reject them. Both halves compare against
`tests/tenkz/release-support/selftest-expectations.toml`.

Neither half touches the release-test inventory's pins or any release tag, so
the suite runs on every pull request rather than only at activation, and a
change that quietly weakened the view is caught on that run.
