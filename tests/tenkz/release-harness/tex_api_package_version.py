"""The package's version declaration, as two independent assertions.

`RELEASE-POLICY.md` §3: the version string lives in one place, the
`\\ProvidesPackage` line of `tex/tenkz/tenkz.sty`, and the manual, change
record, event-format declaration, and release manifest are all checked against
it.

Two things can be wrong with that line and they need separate fingerprints,
because a friction record names the fingerprint and one that stood for both
could not tell a reader whether to fix a duplicated declaration or a malformed
version:

    cardinality   the file carries exactly one declaration
    syntax        every declaration it carries parses as date-and-version

The two are independent. A file with two well-formed declarations fails the
first and passes the second; a file with one malformed declaration does the
reverse.
