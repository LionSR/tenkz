"""The assertion protocol every atomic release test uses.

A release test states one compatibility assertion about one public surface and
reports one of two outcomes.  It exits zero when the assertion holds.  When the
assertion fails it writes the closed receipt at `$TENKZ_TEST_OUTPUT` and exits
exactly ten; `docs/tenkz/SOAK-1.0.md` §Release payload evidence fixes both the
receipt shape and the exit code, and the supervisor rejects any other pairing.

A test that wants to report two failure causes is two tests.  The fingerprint
in `tests/tenkz/release-tests.toml` names the one cause, so a second cause
reaching the same fingerprint would make the friction record unreadable.
