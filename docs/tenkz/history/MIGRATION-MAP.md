# tenkz migration map — completed catalogue-to-native transition

Generated 2026-07-17 from the original migration census:

- 114 catalogue entries, each with at least one chapter call site.
- 140 chapter macro occurrences on 140 lines.
- tenkz surface: `docs/tenkz/USAGE.md` (Phase-0, from the tenkz/06-manual stack worktree) + `docs/tenkz/WHATS-NEW-0.5.md` (0.5 additions + §Gaps = the 0.6 list) — both since superseded and deleted; the current surface is `docs/tenkz/manual2.tex` + `docs/tenkz/chapters2/`.

Spelling note: the tenkz bodies sketched below were written against the
0.5 surface and predate the 0.6 rename sweep — read `close west/east` as
`west=cup` / `east={cup=$m$}`, `plane=` as `frame=`, and so on
(CHANGES-0.6.md has the full table). The sketches are historical migration
evidence, not user documentation; the final chapter sources use 0.6 spellings.

Chapter names below are relative to `blueprint/src/chapter/`, `.tex` dropped. Classes:

| class | migration action |
|---|---|
| empty-equation | delete wrapper, keep the `\ensuremath` formula as plain display math |
| drawn-single-use | inline a `tenkz`/`\tnpic` grid body at the call site |
| multi-use | `\tndefine` candidate (survives as a plain preamble macro; spec PR 1c) |
| cd genre | `tenkzcd` (polygon mode) and/or `\tntree` in math |
| region genre | `tenkzlattice` cell-set regions |
| channel/free genre | sandwich/cups channel spellings, or `tenkzfree` for irregular graphs/stars |

## Class counts

| class | entries | of the 140 macro occurrences |
|---|---:|---:|
| empty-equation → plain display math | **33** | 33 |
| drawn-single-use → inline tenkz grid body | **38** | 38 |
| multi-use → `\tndefine` candidate | **12** | 38 |
| cd genre → tenkzcd / `\tntree` | **5** | 5 |
| region genre → tenkzlattice | **10** | 10 |
| channel/free genre → sandwich-cups / tenkzfree | **16** | 16 |
| **total** | **114** | **140** |

Recount note: the review report (and DESIGN §5/§6) first quoted **34**
empty-equation entries; the measured recount over the catalogue — an
entry is empty iff its body calls no drawing macro at all — finds
exactly **33**, and the review-side counts have been corrected to match.
This table is the authoritative census.

After issue #4556, **13 catalogue declarations and 15 chapter calls** remained,
all in the PEPS chapters. Issue #4557 reduced both counts to zero. The exact
demolition base therefore had no live catalogue records or chapter calls; only
unused implementation and registry files remained. The non-PEPS batch also
retired private helpers with no remaining consumer.

At the original census, the 12 multi-use entries accounted for 38 occurrences
(10+5+3+3+3+2×7); every other entry was single-use. Two multi-use entries
(`TNPEPSNormalRegionsRS`, `TNPEPSNormalRegionT`) had region-genre bodies; three
(`TNPEPSEdgeGaugeOrientation`, `TNPEPSGaugeVertexAction`,
`TNPEPSVertexInjectivityMap`) had free-genre bodies. They are counted once,
under multi-use, even after a row records its later migration. The first two
free-genre entries were demoted to their exact component formulas in issue
#4531.

## Capability disposition (cross-checked against the 0.6 gap list)

The historical WHATS-NEW-0.5 gap list was RMP-reproduction-driven rather
than migration-driven.  This table records the current disposition of its
seven proposed keys; it is not a request to migrate catalogue calls.

| key | disposition | evidence / remaining use |
|---|---|---|
| K1 `\tnspan[box]` | **implemented** | One measured dashed enclosure over a grid-cell range; labels have compass placement. |
| K2 `periodic=physical` | **demoted to exact algebra** | `Papers/1606.00608/MPDO-22-12-17-2.tex:962-967` defines the object by a trace, while `blueprint/src/chapter/ch21_mpdo_rfp_algebraic.tex:35-50` gives its exact components.  A generic vertical graphical trace would add ambiguous ink. |
| K3 lattice physical stubs | **delivered** | The lattice `physical=` policy now draws per-site physical legs, including oblique frames. |
| K4 lattice torus marks | **owned by #4396; delivered by PR #4562** | Opposite-side trace closures and their four-side audit records cover the torus geometry. |
| K5 `pair label=` | **not required** | `TNMPOLocalPurification` remains legible with the existing cup policy or no redundant label. |
| K6 lattice edge insertion | **not required** | After #4531, grid `\tnX` and a named free atom cover the remaining meanings. |
| K7 free-tier region | **implemented** | `\tnregion` accepts named `\tnput` atoms, named `\tnjoin` routes, and earlier named regions through the shared measured renderer. |

Tangential overlap: a bare identity-wire atom would let TNChoiMatrix's `id`
layer be a plain wire instead of a boxed `\tn{\mathrm{id}}` (cosmetic, not
blocking).  No catalogue entry needs another enclosure grammar.

The nine catalogue rows reviewed for the enclosure work have these explicit
dispositions.  `TNPEPSEdgeBlockingReduction` appears once even though it uses
both K1 and K7.

| catalogue entry | requested ink | disposition |
|---|---|---|
| TNBlocking | K1 long blocked word | migrated inline in #4556 with `\tnspan[box]`; declaration removed |
| TNMPDOBlockedRFPChannels | K1 disjoint blocked factors | migrated inline in #4556 with independent spans; declaration and private factor-chain wrappers removed |
| TNMPDOTwoSiteBlocking | K1 two-site capability | migrated inline in #4556 without an enclosure, matching `Papers/1606.00608/MPDO_K=MM.png`; declaration removed |
| TNPEPSEdgeBlockingReduction | K1 blocked row plus K7 graph region | migrated inline in #4557 as the exact five-site source graph with named regions, followed by the cyclic blocked word $A'_1,A'_2,A'_3$; declaration and private motif removed |
| TNPEPSNormalEdgeBlockingReduction | K1 blocked row halves | migrated inline in #4557 as the source $7\times7$ regions followed by an independently customizable cyclic three-tensor network with boundary $(V,P)=(0,3)$; declaration and private motif removed |
| TNMPDOBNTOperatorTraceClosure | K2 vertical closure | demoted in #4556 to `[O_L(M_\alpha)]_{a,b}=\operatorname{tr}(\widehat M_\alpha^{a_1b_1}\cdots\widehat M_\alpha^{a_Lb_L})`; declaration removed and no generic closure key added |
| TNAppendixBAdjacentBondProjectors | K7 named subgraph groups | migrated in #4556 as an inline support-location schematic built from named atoms and joins; declaration removed |
| TNAppendixBPhysicalSupportTransport | K7 overlapping support regions | migrated in #4556 as an inline support-location schematic with symmetric named regions; declaration removed |
| TNPEPSTorusGeometry | K4 torus identifications | migrated inline in #4557 using the capability delivered by PR #4562: a $3\times3$ lattice with both coordinate directions traced, six trace events, and boundary $(V,P)=(0,9)$; declaration and private motif removed |

| TNPEPSInjectiveRegionUnionProof | ch24_peps_ft_normal_union:211 before this migration | four inline `tenkzfree` panels for the two inverse steps and the reinserted intersection, with boundary signatures $(0,3)$, $(4,1)$, $(3,2)$, and $(3,0)$ | migrated inline; declaration and private motif removed |
| TNPEPSNormalRectangleCover | ch24_peps_ft_normal_square, former call | inline $4\times4$ `tenkzlattice` schematic with independently customizable $2\times3$ and $3\times2$ outlined regions; it makes no cover claim, and the adjacent theorem records the present $T$- and $A_3$-cover obstruction | migrated inline in #4557; declaration and private motif removed |

Closeout (#4557): the shared catalogue now has zero `TNPEPS*` declarations,
and the chapter tree has zero `TNPEPS*` calls.  The PEPS motif file, PEPS-only
helper wrappers, `peps_three_site` reference fixture, and PEPS-specific usage
checker and CI flag were removed.  `TNPEPSSite` remains as the documented
generic site atom.  Every replacement environment has a nonempty, locally
customizable body and an adjacent formula, ink-to-index, contraction, boundary,
and source verdict.  The seven formerly hand-digitized region polygons are
represented by `\tnregion` cell sets; none survive as coordinates.

| TNMPDORecursiveStructureOperator | ch21_mpdo_rfp_fusion_isometries:813 | `tenkzfree`: degree-four $X_s$ boxes meet open $k_s,\alpha_s,\beta_s,\gamma_s$ copy rails; $\gamma_s$ and $\alpha_{s+1}$ share one open rail, and the final rail selects traced $M_{\gamma_r}$ with its physical pair open | source-faithful free-tier routing; no package change |

## Completed migration sequence

1. The 33 empty-equation wrappers became exact displayed mathematics.
2. Canonical MPS and channel figures moved to native grid bodies.
3. Fusion and pentagon figures moved to `tenkzcd` and `\tntree`.
4. Region figures moved to `tenkzlattice` cell sets.
5. Irregular PEPS, MPDO, and Appendix B graphs moved to `tenkzfree` or exact
   mathematics according to their cited sources.
6. Repeated names were inlined or demoted; no catalogue-like preamble layer
   survives.

The chapter call count and catalogue declaration count are both zero. The
exact retired-file census and persistent literal-zero checks are recorded in
`DEMOLITION.md`.
