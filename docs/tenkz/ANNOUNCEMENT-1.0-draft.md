## tenkz `[[PENDING-RELEASE: version]]`: a declarative language for tensor-network diagrams

Released `[[PENDING-RELEASE: date]]`.

tenkz is the tensor-network diagram package of the TNLean project. It draws
matrix product states, tensor trains, PEPS sheets, string diagrams, and
channel sandwiches as *declared structure*, not as placed ink: an author
states what the network is, and the package measures where the ink goes.

### Addresses, never coordinates

A tenkz picture is a set of typed records — atoms, wires, and marks — that
live at *addresses* inside a declared frame. A frame (flat grid, projected
plane, or circle) gives every address a place and local axes, so the author
never measures a length and never names a page direction: the outward
physical leg of a row is that row's own normal, a label's quadrant is a
bearing in the host's axes, and orientation is a consequence of where a
record sits. Every index ends in exactly one of a bond, a closure, or a
declared open leg — and `tenkzeq` checks that the two sides of a pictured
equation expose the same boundary signature.

### One figure

The gauge equation Bⁱ = X Aⁱ X⁻¹ of the fundamental theorem of matrix
product states:

```latex
\[
  \begin{tenkz}[cols=1, boundary=open]
    \tn[ports={90:physical:$i$}]{B}
  \end{tenkz}
  \;=\;
  \begin{tenkz}[boundary=open]
    \tn[skin=ring]{X} & \tn[ports={90:physical:$i$}]{A} & \tn[skin=ring]{X^{-1}}
  \end{tenkz}
\]
```

No coordinates, no lengths: the typed port `90:physical` declares each
tensor's outward leg along its row's own normal, `&` chains atoms along the
row, and the protruding stubs on both sides are the same boundary signature
— two open virtual indices and one physical index — which the equation
check verifies.

### The compatibility promise

The manual is the contract. From 1.0 on, the documented surface — the
registry vocabulary of environments, commands, and keys, and the `.tnlog`
event stream the checking tools consume — changes only per the versioning
policy (`[[PENDING-RELEASE: policy-section]]`): patch releases fix rendering
defects, minor releases extend the vocabulary by declaration, and breaking
changes require a major release. Older documents keep compiling through the
compatibility spellings listed exhaustively in the manual's compatibility
chapter; each alias reads old sources and normalizes to the same semantic
events as its canonical replacement.

### Where things live

- Package on CTAN: `[[PENDING-RELEASE: ctan-url]]`
- Manual (PDF): ships with the package; source at `docs/tenkz/` in the
  TNLean repository
- Release notes and archive: `[[PENDING-RELEASE: release-url]]`
  (archive hash `[[PENDING-RELEASE: archive-hash]]`, frozen at
  `[[PENDING-RELEASE: release-sha]]`)
- Project: <https://github.com/LionSR/tenkz>

### Known limitations

- tenkz is a LaTeX package (expl3 over TikZ); it renders where LaTeX
  renders.
- It is a tensor-network language, not a general commutative-diagram tool;
  coherence diagrams are better served by plain tikz-cd.
- Compatibility spellings exist to read older documents. New documents use
  canonical spellings; the compatibility chapter is a sunset list, not a
  second surface.
- The language grows by declaration (`\tndeclare`), not by per-figure
  drawing commands; raw-coordinate escape hatches exist but sit outside the
  checked surface.
