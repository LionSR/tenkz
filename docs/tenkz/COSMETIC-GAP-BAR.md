# The RMP cosmetic-gap bar

The RMP benchmark seeks mathematical parity in tenkz's own graceful house
style. It does not seek pixel identity with the author source. A difference in
colour, line weight, glyph outline, slant, or equivalent planar routing is
therefore faithful when it preserves the mathematical object, topology,
boundary, labels, orientation, and declared crossing order.

This distinction controls the verdict:

- **K1 — recorded property:** the model records the property but the renderer
  does not yet ink it. Fix the shared renderer or theme, then re-review every
  affected case. Do not patch individual cases.
- **K2 — house style or stale note:** the note records an intentional house
  form, an equivalent presentation, or a correction that has already removed
  the stated defect. Re-review the hash-pinned render and promote it to
  `faithful`; do not redraw it to imitate source pixels.
- **K3 — gracefulness:** the meaning is intact, but the default rendering is
  loose, crowded, oversized, or ambiguous. Prefer a shared metric, route, skin,
  or family-level fix. Use a case-local adjustment only when the geometry is
  genuinely exceptional.
- **K4 — small omission:** a finite source item such as a label, arrow, tensor,
  leg, or projection mark is absent or extra. Fix and re-review the individual
  case.
- **X — not cosmetic:** the ledger itself contradicts the cosmetic status by
  recording a topological, boundary, contraction, ordering, or crossing
  defect. Move the case to the appropriate ordinary RMP verdict before any
  cosmetic sweep.

`cosmetic-gap` is reserved for K1, K3, and K4 while their stated residue is
visible. K2 is not a permanent gap class: after a visual check confirms that
the mathematical contract is intact, its verdict and note should become
`faithful`. X is an audit escalation, not a fifth cosmetic kind.

## Current classification

This table classifies the 98 `cosmetic-gap` verdicts at merge
`c3b4667c10faa7cadaf4a18fdbab3bc72b85fa18`. The reason column records the
disposition of the current verdict note; it is not a substitute for the
hash-pinned visual check required before changing a verdict.

| `rmp-ii-mpu-normal-form` | K3 | The solid S-route is heavier and less compact than the graceful default should be. |
| `rmp-ii-spectrum-transfer` | K3 | Supply the shared designed tail idiom for the two fixed-point tails. |

| `rmp-ii-ortho-left` | K2 | Thin house wires versus bold source wires are intentional styling. |

| `rmp-ii-boundary-region` | K2 | The boundary is recorded as repaired; no residue is named. |
| `rmp-ii-boundary-state` | K2 | A brace versus a box is an equivalent house mark for the same region. |
| `rmp-ii-zcl-mpdo` | K3 | Make the shared trace closure more compact than the current racetrack. |
| `rmp-ii-channels-ts` | K2 | Straight double arrows versus curved source arcs are equivalent house routing. |
| `rmp-ii-mpdo-ol` | K4 | Reconcile the ledger's finite `extra-element` defect with the note saying the contrast panel is gone, then re-review the hook spacing. |
| `rmp-ii-peps-rg` | X | The current hooks cross where the source keeps them separated; restore the source crossing topology. |

| `rmp-iii-a-ghz-tensor` | K2 | Copy dot versus labelled box and diagonal angle are equivalent house forms. |

| `rmp-iii-a-mpo-action` | K3 | Restore a graceful diagonal physical-leg route. |

| `rmp-iv-intersection-rhs-six` | X | Promoted to `blocked`: the missing `nested-regions` capability leaves an invented lattice and the wrong contraction. |
| `rmp-app-czx-state` | K2 | Lighter enclosure fill is a public-theme choice. |
| `rmp-workbench-ii-newfig7` | K2 | Crossing-gadget styling is a house-form difference. |
| `rmp-workbench-ii-projector-on-pta` | X | Promoted to `structural-gap`: omitting two of four source triangles changes the multiplicity of the sandwich sum. |
| `rmp-workbench-ii-peps-rg-workbench` | X | Its ledger pairing is `wrong-source`; repair and verify the source mapping before judging the U-application idiom. |
| `rmp-workbench-ii-positive-mpo-old` | K2 | The ledger already records equal X sizes; re-review the hash-pinned render as faithful. |

| `rmp-workbench-iii-f-tensor` | K2 | An explicit F box faithfully replaces the source's boxless crossing. |

| `rmp-workbench-iii-ghz-up` | K3 | Improve glyph proportions and leg geometry as a family. |
| `rmp-workbench-iii-g-injective-pull` | X | Re-audit the source pairing: the current diagonal `U_g` belongs to the SPT panel. |

## Sweep order

1. Correct every X ledger contradiction and handle it under the ordinary RMP
   structural verdict and repair process.
2. Re-review K2 against the current hash-pinned renders and change only the
   verdict metadata where the contract is intact.
3. Group K1 by the owning renderer/theme capability. Land one shared fix,
   rerender every consumer, and retire all residues it actually removes.
4. Group K3 by closure, tail, hook, pitch, glyph, gauge-route, and spacing
   families. Each family change must improve the default rather than merely
   move one case closer to legacy pixels.
5. Fix K4 in small source-family batches with side-by-side visual review.

Every batch still runs the focused RMP check, the full RMP audit, the shrink
ratchet, and the standalone tenkz corpus before its verdict hashes change.
