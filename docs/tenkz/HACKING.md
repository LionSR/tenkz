# Hacking on tenkz

`LANGUAGE.md` is the public semantic contract.  `ARCHITECTURE.md` owns the
internal pipeline.  This file is the operational checklist for changing and
debugging the package.

## Fast build loop

Compile a standalone example from its own directory.  Keep the timeout: an
expl3 loop over an expanded `\q_no_value` otherwise looks like a slow run.

```sh
timeout 120 env TEXINPUTS="<repo>/tex/tenkz//:" \
  xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error <file>.tex
```

Build the compact manual twice for contents and references:

```sh
python3 scripts/tenkz_manual_doctest.py
cd docs/tenkz
timeout 150 env TEXINPUTS="../../tex/tenkz//:" \
  xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error manual2.tex
timeout 150 env TEXINPUTS="../../tex/tenkz//:" \
  xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error manual2.tex
```

The generated language reference is
`chapters2/generated-language-reference.tex`.  Regenerate it from the
executable registry at `tex/tenkz/tenkz-language-registry.tex`; parser-facing
language code lives in `tex/tenkz/tenkz-language.code.tex`.  Do not edit the
generated file as an independent vocabulary list.  The manual has a short
fallback so a clean pre-generation checkout still compiles.

The RMP book has a separate driver and interface:

```sh
python3 scripts/tenkz_rmp.py check --id <target>
python3 scripts/tenkz_rmp.py check --section <section>
python3 scripts/tenkz_rmp.py check --all
python3 scripts/tenkz_rmp.py book --all
python3 scripts/tenkz_rmp.py render --all
python3 scripts/tenkz_rmp.py compare --all \
  --source-root References/RMP_TIKZ_SOURCE_CODE
```

Every command first runs the corpus-wide physical-dimension ownership check,
even when `check --id` selects one target.  Case dimensions are classified as
metric, projection/frame, route/string, or composition/layout and ratcheted in
`scripts/tenkzlib/dimensions.py`; comment dimensions fail separately.  The two
fixed benchmark-book page-layout files have exact path-specific counts and do
not count as figure geometry.  These core ceilings are aggregate ratchets:
net reductions pass and uncompensated count increases fail.  Exact balanced
replacement and ownership-site moves are the per-occurrence gate supplied by
#5378; until that lands, they require manual review.

The comparison command requires a separate author-source tree supplied through
`--source-root`.  The canonical local home is the gitignored
`References/RMP_TIKZ_SOURCE_CODE/` directory.  It contains the authors'
standalone `ImagesReview Section II` through `ImagesReview Section V` source
drop used to establish the `author_source` and `author_lines` pairings in
`tests/tenkz/rmp/manifest.toml`; the source drop is not redistributed by this
repository.

The four cited section files are identified by
`tests/tenkz/rmp/author-source.sha256`.  `compare` verifies and snapshots those
files before compiling any corpus target, so a missing, edited, or different
source drop fails quickly and later filesystem changes cannot alter the
comparison.  Pairing verdicts are also bound to the source identities and
extraction ranges by `pairing_sha256` in `tests/tenkz/rmp/verdicts.toml`.
Generated PDFs, auxiliary files, logs, and filesystem metadata are not
provenance: only the section sources cited by the pairing manifest define the
external authority.  A source tree in another local directory is acceptable
only when it matches the committed hashes.

Per-target verdicts are stored in `tests/tenkz/rmp/verdicts.toml`, one
stanza per target.  Any status may be recorded, including failure; the check
rejects lies, never gaps: a stale `case_sha256`, a `faithful` claim without a
second viewer and a verified pairing, or a `blocked` entry that names no
missing capability all fail, while recorded gaps merely appear in the book's
histogram.  A judged verdict pins the SHA-256 of its case; editing the case
stales exactly that verdict.

The ordinary 257-fixture corpus keeps its existing default interface:

```sh
scripts/tenkz_corpus.sh
scripts/tenkz_corpus.sh --render
```

Both suites may share lower-level helpers; neither frontend changes the
other's defaults.

## Golden event streams

The event ledger is `tests/tenkz/golden-events.sha256`.

```sh
scripts/tenkz_golden.sh --check
```

The check recompiles every top-level `tests/tenkz/*.tex` standalone fixture and
requires each `.tnlog` event stream to be byte-identical to the stored SHA-256
baseline.  Nested suites such as `tests/tenkz/kernel/` have their own gates.
Run the command without an argument to take a new snapshot:

```sh
scripts/tenkz_golden.sh
```

Re-pin only when fixture source changes or a reviewed package contract change
intentionally changes the emitted events, and the new streams have been
reviewed as the intended contract.  Behavior-preserving package changes must
pass `--check`; they do not authorize a new baseline.

## Same-session pixel pairs

Pixel evidence compares two package revisions in one session:

```sh
scripts/tenkz_pixelpair.sh origin/main
```

The command creates a detached worktree at the base revision, renders the
renderer-only source manifest against that true legacy package and the current
package, rasterizes both at 300 dpi, and compares the paired pages byte for
byte.  A copied package tree is not a legacy control.  Stored raster hashes are
not cross-revision redraw evidence because raster bytes depend on the machine
and TeX epoch.  The exact-toolchain pins in
`tests/tenkz/kernel/golden-pixels.sha256` are a narrower regression gate:
after an approved XeTeX, Poppler, font, or intentional render change, inspect
the full-resolution fixtures.  Before re-pinning, run
`scripts/tenkz_kernel_probes.sh --check`: an expected pixel mismatch is
acceptable, but every non-pixel probe must pass, including structural
assertions, sugar-expansion parity, and the event-stream comparison.  If a
separate reviewed contract change intentionally affects a non-pixel pin, review
and update that contract first, then rerun until every non-pixel probe passes.
Do not snapshot after any non-pixel failure.  Then re-pin with
`scripts/tenkz_kernel_probes.sh --snapshot`, which updates both the pixel and
event ledgers.

This command exists for the redraw campaign and expires at its close, no later
than 1.0.  Do not turn it into a permanent raster manifest.

## Shrink sessions

The shrink checker reports six meters:

1. public vocabulary census;
2. parser-leaf paths;
3. escape-spelling use in the demand corpus;
4. mean non-comment lines across the 130 RMP cases;
5. aliases and their sunsets;
6. overloaded names, union types, and shared enum words.

```sh
python3 scripts/tenkz_shrink.py meters
python3 scripts/tenkz_shrink.py flags
python3 scripts/tenkz_shrink.py gate --base-ref origin/main
```

When any intentional change alters a computed meter—including a registry,
demand-corpus, or parser-source identity change—compute and review the new
baseline before the gate:

```sh
python3 scripts/tenkz_shrink.py meters > /tmp/tenkz-census-baseline.json
diff -u tests/tenkz/census-baseline.json /tmp/tenkz-census-baseline.json
cp /tmp/tenkz-census-baseline.json tests/tenkz/census-baseline.json
python3 scripts/tenkz_shrink.py gate --base-ref origin/main
```

At the start of a new 0.9 or 1.0 shrink session, advance
`CURRENT_MILESTONE` in `scripts/tenkz_shrink.py` in the same change.  The
`flags` and `gate` actions use that constant to decide which alias sunsets are
due.

The registry's implementation ledgers are `kernel` and `sugar(...)`: kernel
rows are one-in-one-out vocabulary, while sugar rows must expand into kernel
spellings and earn continued use.  The other status words record lifecycle
debt: `alias(...; sunset=...)` reads old sources until its stated rewrite, and
`escape` names raw geometry whose uses count in meter M3.

The gate first compares the pinned meters with the base revision.  M1 total or
kernel growth requires an `Extension-gate: #NNNN` citation, or a
`Census-correction: #NNNN` citation while parser identities are unchanged;
command or environment growth permits only the extension citation.  M2
path-count growth and every parser-leaf identity change, including replacement
or removal, require the extension citation.  M3 or M4 growth requires the
census-correction citation.  M6 component growth also requires a census
correction while parser identities are unchanged.  M5 alias-count growth is
rejected unconditionally, and every alias must have a valid sunset.

After that ratchet passes, a public-census decrease is accepted.  Otherwise,
every raised low-consumer, co-occurrence, lonely-type, sugar-shaped, and due
alias-sunset flag needs a verdict in the latest `docs/tenkz/SHRINK.md` session.
The ledger is append-only: retain the entire pre-change file byte-for-byte as a
prefix and add corrections and verdicts in a new final session section.

A verdict is a table row whose first cell is the exact `flag:*` ID printed by
`flags` (escape an internal table pipe as `\|`).  Its second cell must begin
with one of `keep-because`, `keep`, `dies`, `demoted`, `folds`, `respelled`,
`becomes`, `moves`, `confirmed`, `confirmed merge`, `tombstoned`,
or `sugar preset` and include an unexpired `expiry <milestone>` or `permanent`
lifetime.  The alternative execution form must begin exactly
`executes at the <milestone> freeze`.  Prose outside such a row is not a
machine-readable verdict.

## Shared parsers

`scripts/tenkzlib/tnlog.py` is the canonical schema-validating parser for
`.tnlog` event streams.  Use it whenever a checker needs structured event
fields.  Some narrow regression tests still inspect raw lines directly,
including `scripts/test_tenkz_cd_map_labels.py`,
`scripts/test_tenkz_enclosures.py`, and `scripts/test_tenkz_peps_torus.py`.
Before changing event syntax, field order, or validation, search every `.tnlog`
consumer and update or migrate these exceptions; do not assume the canonical
parser is their only dependency.
`scripts/tenkzlib/texcase.py` provides shared TeX comment stripping,
balanced-group matching, and picture-construct scanning.  Import these modules
when adding or modifying a checker that needs those answers.
Known local balanced-group parsers remain in
`scripts/tenkz_shrink.py::_group_payload` and
`scripts/tenkz_language.py::_group`; keep both aligned until they migrate to
`texcase.py`.  RMP case-header extraction remains local to
`scripts/tenkz_rmp.py`; do not claim it as shared until it moves into the
library.  Never add another parser for syntax already parsed by
`scripts/tenkzlib/`.

## Stage ownership

Each stage file begins with its declared input, output, owned-state, invariant,
and next-stage contract.

These are normative ownership rules for new code and migration destinations,
not a claim that every historical path has moved.  The live `tenkz-core`,
`tenkz-grid`, `tenkz-cd`, `tenkz-lattice`, and `tenkz-free` files still combine
some parsing, geometry, rendering, and event work; direct `\draw` or `\node`
emission in those files remains migration debt.

- `tenkz-model.code.tex` owns normalized semantic records and freezes topology
  after validation.
- `tenkz-metric.code.tex` owns the motivated metric registry and its sole
  dimension accessor.
- `tenkz-geometry.code.tex` owns frames, placement resolution, directions, and
  silhouette support distances; it emits no ink.
- `tenkz-render.code.tex` owns final mark and string emission from frozen
  records and resolved geometry; it parses nothing and stores no topology.
- `tenkz-string.code.tex` owns saved string paths and the crossing, join, and
  gap ledgers consumed by rendering.

The string stage has one further explicit exception: until string/render
integration is complete, string fixtures use the temporary
`\__tenkz_string_dev_draw:nn` primitive in `tenkz-string.code.tex`, which issues
the development `\draw` directly.

Read the header before changing a stage, and keep new state in the stage that
owns its answer.

## Pull-request evidence

Every change under `tex/tenkz/` records both semantic and visual evidence in
the pull-request body:

```sh
scripts/tenkz_golden.sh --check
scripts/tenkz_pixelpair.sh origin/main
```

The golden gate proves event-stream parity for the top-level corpus fixtures.
Run the applicable suite-specific semantic gates for affected nested fixtures.
The same-session pixel pair proves render parity only for the fixtures listed in
`tests/tenkz/pixelpair-sources.txt`.  If a change can affect a fixture outside
that manifest, add the affected fixture to the comparison or attach reviewed
replacement render evidence.  If a reviewed contract or drawing intentionally
changes, state the affected fixtures and attach the reviewed replacement
evidence instead of claiming parity.

The demolition checker remains a temporary guard against restoring retired
catalogue paths and expires at the 0.8 close, after branches predating the
demolition have landed or died.  The pixel-pair command expires with the redraw
campaign at 1.0.

## Audit and visual review

After compiling, audit the exact event stream used by the rendering and lint
the source:

```sh
python3 scripts/tenkz_audit.py <job>.tnlog
python3 scripts/tenkz_lint.py <source>.tex
```

Render every affected PDF and inspect it.  Exit status is not visual review.

```sh
mkdir -p tmp/pdfs/tenkz
pdftocairo -png -r 200 -singlefile <file>.pdf \
  tmp/pdfs/tenkz/<name>
```

Inspect labels, clipped ink, crossings, region contours, paired pages, and
section transitions.  A meaningful geometry change requires a fresh render.
Generated PDFs and PNGs are build artifacts, not committed source.

## Source and event checks

- Each figure states `Formula`, `Ink`, `Boundary`, `Source`, and
  `Capabilities` in its source header where the corpus format requires them.
- Structural capability tags name the public construct that owns the picture
  model. A `\tenkzkernel` case therefore carries `kernel`, even when its
  renderer contains a nested `tenkz` environment; `grid` is reserved for the
  grid surface without the kernel wrapper.
- A diagrammatic equation has the intended boundary signature on both sides.
- A matrix keeps two open virtual indices, a doubled-space map keeps four,
  and a scalar keeps none.
- The applied channel is `[sandwich, east={cup=$X$}]`; a west cup feeds the
  adjoint.
- Canonical sources do not use aliases, private control sequences, raw
  `tikzpicture`, whole-figure macros, or undocumented coordinate escapes.
- `\tndeclareatom` declarations have complete typed ports.  There is no
  public `\tndefine` mechanism.

## Architecture checks

Before editing a stage, read its five-line contract.  Maintain the direction

```text
language -> model -> style/atoms -> geometry -> dialect layout -> rendering -> events
```

Validation ends before measurement.  Rendering neither parses user syntax nor
changes topology.  Public names come from the executable registry; private
names follow `\__tenkz_<owner>_...:`.  Unsupported requested ink is a coded
error, never a warning followed by omission.

Until the S4 surface swap, kernel package loading is inert with respect to the
0.7 surface. `KERNEL-LOAD-SWEEP.md` records the binding and key-tree audit and
the regression that protects this boundary.

## expl3 and PGF traps

These mistakes have shipped bugs here.

1. Never expand `\q_no_value`.  Use the house accessor or a TF form of
   `\prop_get`.
2. Integer factors sit to the right of `*` in `\dimexpr`; prefer
   `\dim_eval:n`.  Do not put a leading decimal factor before a dimension
   macro in a pgfkeys value.
3. Double parameter tokens inside nested inline mappings: `##1` in the body
   of an `\int_step_inline:nnn` defined by another macro.
4. Normalize integer registers with `\int_eval:n` before using them as
   property keys.
5. User-input colons have catcode 12.  String-normalize before parsing
   `rows=`, `ports=`, and similar delimited forms.
6. `\use:e` passes `#` literally; do not double it there.
7. PGF keys split at literal commas and an unbraced value can be truncated at
   a second equals sign.  Brace values containing either character.
8. Expand integer registers explicitly in `\iow` event writes.
9. Picture IDs nest: the global UID and group-local current ID have different
   ownership.  An inline `\tnpic` must not clobber its parent.

## Geometry discipline

One base pitch controls the metric.  Repeated dimensions are named ratios.
Clearance uses the measured silhouette plus the single daylight separation;
do not add a constant that predicts what another pass will draw.

Useful focused regressions include:

```sh
python3 scripts/test_tenkz_face_ports.py
python3 scripts/test_tenkz_label_overlap.py
python3 scripts/test_tenkz_enclosures.py
```

Run the focused test while iterating, then the affected corpus or benchmark
section, then the repository gates appropriate to the change.

## Historical design records

Superseded design proposals, migration inventories, reviews, and 0.6
worklists live under `docs/tenkz/history/`.  They explain earlier decisions but
do not define current syntax.  Do not revive a spelling from history without
passing the extension gates in `LANGUAGE.md`.
