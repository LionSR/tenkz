# Hacking on tenkz

`LANGUAGE.md` is the public semantic contract.  `ARCHITECTURE.md` owns the
internal pipeline.  This file is the operational checklist for changing and
debugging the package.

## Fast build loop

Compile a standalone example from its own directory.  Keep the timeout: an
expl3 loop over an expanded `\q_no_value` otherwise looks like a slow run.

```sh
timeout 120 env TEXINPUTS="<repo>/tex/tenkz//:" \
  xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error <file>.tex
```

Build the compact manual twice for contents and references:

```sh
python3 scripts/tenkz_manual_doctest.py
cd docs/tenkz
timeout 150 env TEXINPUTS="../../tex/tenkz//:" \
  xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error manual2.tex
timeout 150 env TEXINPUTS="../../tex/tenkz//:" \
  xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error manual2.tex
```

The generated language reference is
`chapters2/generated-language-reference.tex`.  Regenerate it from the
executable registry at `tex/tenkz/tenkz-language-registry.tex`; parser-facing
language code lives in `tex/tenkz/tenkz-language.code.tex`.  Do not edit the
generated file as an independent vocabulary list.  The manual has a short
fallback so a clean pre-generation checkout still compiles.

The RMP book has a separate driver and interface:

```sh
python3 scripts/tenkz_rmp.py check --id <target>
python3 scripts/tenkz_rmp.py check --section <section>
python3 scripts/tenkz_rmp.py check --all
python3 scripts/tenkz_rmp.py book --all
python3 scripts/tenkz_rmp.py render --all
python3 scripts/tenkz_rmp.py compare --all \
  --source-root /absolute/path/to/author-source-tree
```

The comparison command requires a separate author-source tree supplied through
`--source-root`.  That tree is not part of this repository, so comparison is not
a clean-checkout build command.  Run it only in a source-pairing session with an
explicit external tree.

Per-target verdicts are stored in `tests/tenkz/rmp/verdicts.toml`, one
stanza per target.  Any status may be recorded, including failure; the check
rejects lies, never gaps: a stale `case_sha256`, a `faithful` claim without a
second viewer and a verified pairing, or a `blocked` entry that names no
missing capability all fail, while recorded gaps merely appear in the book's
histogram.  A judged verdict pins the SHA-256 of its case; editing the case
stales exactly that verdict.

The ordinary 257-fixture corpus keeps its existing default interface:

```sh
scripts/tenkz_corpus.sh
scripts/tenkz_corpus.sh --render
```

Both suites may share lower-level helpers; neither frontend changes the
other's defaults.

## Golden event streams

The event ledger is `tests/tenkz/golden-events.sha256`.

```sh
scripts/tenkz_golden.sh --check
```

The check recompiles every standalone fixture and requires each `.tnlog` event
stream to be byte-identical to the stored SHA-256 baseline.  Run the command
without an argument to take a new snapshot:

```sh
scripts/tenkz_golden.sh
```

Re-pin only when fixture source changes and the new event stream has been
reviewed as the intended contract.  Package-only changes must pass `--check`;
they do not authorize a new baseline.

## Same-session pixel pairs

Pixel evidence compares two package revisions in one session:

```sh
scripts/tenkz_pixelpair.sh origin/main
```

The command creates a detached worktree at the base revision, renders the
renderer-only source manifest against that true legacy package and the current
package, rasterizes both at 300 dpi, and compares the paired pages byte for
byte.  A copied package tree is not a legacy control.  Stored raster hashes are
not evidence because raster bytes depend on the machine and TeX epoch.

This command exists for the redraw campaign and expires at its close, no later
than 1.0.  Do not turn it into a permanent raster manifest.

## Shrink sessions

The shrink checker reports six meters:

1. public vocabulary census;
2. parser-leaf paths;
3. escape-spelling use in the demand corpus;
4. mean non-comment lines across the 130 RMP cases;
5. aliases and their sunsets;
6. overloaded names, union types, and shared enum words.

```sh
python3 scripts/tenkz_shrink.py meters
python3 scripts/tenkz_shrink.py flags
python3 scripts/tenkz_shrink.py gate --base-ref origin/main
```

The registry's implementation ledgers are `kernel` and `sugar(...)`: kernel
rows are one-in-one-out vocabulary, while sugar rows must expand into kernel
spellings and earn continued use.  The other status words record lifecycle
debt: `alias(...; sunset=...)` reads old sources until its stated rewrite, and
`escape` names raw geometry whose uses count in meter M3.

The gate compares the pinned meters with the base revision.  It passes when
the public census decreases, or when the census is stable and every raised
low-consumer, co-occurrence, lonely-type, or sugar-shaped flag has a verdict in
the latest `docs/tenkz/SHRINK.md` session.  Alias-sunset flags require verdicts
there as soon as their milestone is due.  Meter growth requires the recorded
extension or census-correction procedure.

## Shared parsers

`scripts/tenkzlib/tnlog.py` is the single parser for `.tnlog` event streams.
`scripts/tenkzlib/texcase.py` owns TeX comment stripping, balanced-group
matching, and picture-construct scanning.  Import these modules whenever a
checker needs those answers.  RMP case-header extraction remains local to
`scripts/tenkz_rmp.py`; do not claim it as shared until it moves into the
library.  Never re-parse syntax already parsed by `scripts/tenkzlib/`.

## Stage ownership

Each stage file begins with its complete input, output, owned-state, invariant,
and next-stage contract.

- `tenkz-model.code.tex` owns normalized semantic records and freezes topology
  after validation.
- `tenkz-metric.code.tex` owns the motivated metric registry and its sole
  dimension accessor.
- `tenkz-geometry.code.tex` owns frames, placement resolution, directions, and
  silhouette support distances; it emits no ink.
- `tenkz-render.code.tex` owns mark emission from frozen records and resolved
  geometry; it parses nothing and stores no topology.
- `tenkz-string.code.tex` owns saved string paths and the crossing, join, and
  gap ledgers consumed by rendering.

Read the header before changing a stage, and keep new state in the stage that
owns its answer.

## Pull-request evidence

Every change under `tex/tenkz/` records both semantic and visual evidence in
the pull-request body:

```sh
scripts/tenkz_golden.sh --check
scripts/tenkz_pixelpair.sh origin/main
```

The golden gate proves event-stream parity.  The same-session pixel pair proves
render parity only for the fixtures listed in
`tests/tenkz/pixelpair-sources.txt`.  If a change can affect a fixture outside
that manifest, add the affected fixture to the comparison or attach reviewed
replacement render evidence.  If a reviewed contract or drawing intentionally
changes, state the affected fixtures and attach the reviewed replacement
evidence instead of claiming parity.

The demolition checker remains a temporary guard against restoring retired
catalogue paths and expires at the 0.8 close, after branches predating the
demolition have landed or died.  The pixel-pair command expires with the redraw
campaign at 1.0.

## Audit and visual review

After compiling, audit the exact event stream used by the rendering and lint
the source:

```sh
python3 scripts/tenkz_audit.py <job>.tnlog
python3 scripts/tenkz_lint.py <source>.tex
```

Render every affected PDF and inspect it.  Exit status is not visual review.

```sh
mkdir -p tmp/pdfs/tenkz
pdftocairo -png -r 200 -singlefile <file>.pdf \
  tmp/pdfs/tenkz/<name>
```

Inspect labels, clipped ink, crossings, region contours, paired pages, and
section transitions.  A meaningful geometry change requires a fresh render.
Generated PDFs and PNGs are build artifacts, not committed source.

## Source and event checks

- Each figure states `Formula`, `Ink`, `Boundary`, `Source`, and
  `Capabilities` in its source header where the corpus format requires them.
- Structural capability tags name the public construct that owns the picture
  model. A `\tenkzkernel` case therefore carries `kernel`, even when its
  renderer contains a nested `tenkz` environment; `grid` is reserved for the
  grid surface without the kernel wrapper.
- A diagrammatic equation has the intended boundary signature on both sides.
- A matrix keeps two open virtual indices, a doubled-space map keeps four,
  and a scalar keeps none.
- The applied channel is `[sandwich, east={cup=$X$}]`; a west cup feeds the
  adjoint.
- Canonical sources do not use aliases, private control sequences, raw
  `tikzpicture`, whole-figure macros, or undocumented coordinate escapes.
- `\tndeclareatom` declarations have complete typed ports.  There is no
  public `\tndefine` mechanism.

## Architecture checks

Before editing a stage, read its five-line contract.  Maintain the direction

```text
language -> model -> style/atoms -> geometry -> dialect layout -> rendering -> events
```

Validation ends before measurement.  Rendering neither parses user syntax nor
changes topology.  Public names come from the executable registry; private
names follow `\__tenkz_<owner>_...:`.  Unsupported requested ink is a coded
error, never a warning followed by omission.

Until the S4 surface swap, kernel package loading is inert with respect to the
0.7 surface. `KERNEL-LOAD-SWEEP.md` records the binding and key-tree audit and
the regression that protects this boundary.

## expl3 and PGF traps

These mistakes have shipped bugs here.

1. Never expand `\q_no_value`.  Use the house accessor or a TF form of
   `\prop_get`.
2. Integer factors sit to the right of `*` in `\dimexpr`; prefer
   `\dim_eval:n`.  Do not put a leading decimal factor before a dimension
   macro in a pgfkeys value.
3. Double parameter tokens inside nested inline mappings: `##1` in the body
   of an `\int_step_inline:nnn` defined by another macro.
4. Normalize integer registers with `\int_eval:n` before using them as
   property keys.
5. User-input colons have catcode 12.  String-normalize before parsing
   `rows=`, `ports=`, and similar delimited forms.
6. `\use:e` passes `#` literally; do not double it there.
7. PGF keys split at literal commas and an unbraced value can be truncated at
   a second equals sign.  Brace values containing either character.
8. Expand integer registers explicitly in `\iow` event writes.
9. Picture IDs nest: the global UID and group-local current ID have different
   ownership.  An inline `\tnpic` must not clobber its parent.

## Geometry discipline

One base pitch controls the metric.  Repeated dimensions are named ratios.
Clearance uses the measured silhouette plus the single daylight separation;
do not add a constant that predicts what another pass will draw.

Useful focused regressions include:

```sh
python3 scripts/test_tenkz_face_ports.py
python3 scripts/test_tenkz_label_overlap.py
python3 scripts/test_tenkz_enclosures.py
```

Run the focused test while iterating, then the affected corpus or benchmark
section, then the repository gates appropriate to the change.

## Historical design records

Superseded design proposals, migration inventories, reviews, and 0.6
worklists live under `docs/tenkz/history/`.  They explain earlier decisions but
do not define current syntax.  Do not revive a spelling from history without
passing the extension gates in `LANGUAGE.md`.
